# tic-tac-toe

The Odin Project: creating a game of tic-tac-toe in Ruby

What I learned:
- how to improve organization into classes, making sure to only share information between classes when necessary
- how to make two classes interact
- how to get the difference between two arrays
- how to use the #any?, #empty?, and #include? methods
